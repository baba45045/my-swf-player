# SWF Video Player

This repository hosts an old-style SWF video player and the necessary files to run it using [Ruffle](https://ruffle.rs/), a Flash Player emulator.

## Files

- `2007.swf` — The original SWF video player file.  
- `index.html` — An example HTML file embedding the SWF player with Ruffle.

## How to Use

1. Open `index.html` in a modern browser.  
2. The video player will load and play using Ruffle, without needing Adobe Flash.  
3. Alternatively, you can open `2007.swf` directly in a Flash-enabled player or emulator.
